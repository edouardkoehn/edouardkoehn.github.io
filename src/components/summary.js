        Deep learning specialist at <a href="https://weill.ucsf.edu/">UCSF</a>, I am working on leveraging AI to improve the functional ultrasound (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1641">fUS</a>) modality.
        At the <a href="https://psychiatry.ucsf.edu/research/di-ianni-lab">Di Ianni Lab</a>, we are a team of engineers driven by the goal of advancing translational medicineâ€”bridging cutting-edge technology with clinical applications to better understand and treat brain disorders.

        Thanks to inspiring professors and collaborators, I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse array of problems and data types, including MRI, fluorescent microscopy, text, and EMG data.
        Through these projects, I have developed a strong expertise in biological data analysis.
        Overall, my academic background has provided me with a solid foundation in statistics, signal processing, biology, and computer science.
        I am currently particularly interested in <strong>Brain-Computer Interfaces</strong>, <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</strong>, and <strong>Mammalian Movement Control</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A strong believer in the potential of AI and Machine Learning for advancing human medicine and healthcare systems, I am motivated by opportunities where these technologies can be leveraged for the common good.
        Interdisciplinary by training, I am eager to collaborate with individuals from diverse backgrounds on impactful projects.

            I am currently a visiting student at <a href="https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/">UC Berkeley</a>, working on biologically constrained Recurrent Neuronal Networks (RNN) under the supervision of <a href="https://biosciences.lbl.gov/profiles/kristofer-e-bouchard/">K. Bouchard</a>.
            Fascinated by the complex machinery that represents the brain, I am pursuing my engineering education in the Neuro-X master's program at <a href="https://neuro-x.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a>.
