Visiting @ [Neural System and Machine Learning Lab, UC Berkeley](https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/)

### Bio
I am currently a visiting student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), working on biologically constrained Recurrent Neuronal Networks. I enrolled in the Neuro-X master's program at the [EPFL](https://neuro-x.epfl.ch/en/). Proudly grounded in the interdisciplinary field, I made my way from biomechanics and sports science to computational neuroscience. 

I am passionate about using computer science to explain and understand behavior. 

Subjects that I would like to explore in the future:

- Graph neuronal networks 
- Mammalian movement control 

### Projects

- Digital humanities: [Lausanne Time Machine](https://projects.lausannetimemachine.ch/student-project-2023-2024-presse/).
- [Identification of the optimal racing line for top male athletes on a segment of a World Cup downhill alpine ski slope using tracking data](https://ciss-journal.org/article/view/9875).
