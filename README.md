Visiting @ [Neural System and Machine Learning Lab, UC Berkeley](https://bouchardlab.lbl.gov/)

### Bio
I am currently a visiting student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), working on biologically constrained Recurrent Neuronal Networks. I am enrolled in the Neuro-X master's program at [EPFL](https://neuro-x.epfl.ch/en/). Proudly grounded in the interdisciplinary field, I made my way from biomechanics and sports science to computational neuroscience. 

I am passionate about using computer science to explain and understand behavior. In parallel to my scientific life, I am an outdoor enthusiast, trying to enjoy the outdoors by doing rock climbing, hiking, and biking. 

Subjects that I would like to explore in the future:
- Brain-computer interfaces
- Graph neuronal networks 
- Mammalian movement control 

### Projects
